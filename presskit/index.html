              <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
              <p>
                 StarCitizen Tracker attempts to fact-check Chris Roberts and Cloud Imperium Games Corporation to see if they adhere to the expectations set concerning the record breaking kickstarter project &quot;Star Citizen&quot; and it&#x27;s accompanying single player mode &quot;Squadron 42&quot;. The tracker is a crowdsourced endeavor started on April 17th, 2017 and may contain minor inaccuracies. Interpretation of progress is primarily left to the reader.
               </p>
              
              <h2 id="history">History and Information</h2>
              
              <h3>Origin</h3>
              <p>StarCitizen Tracker was forked from TrumpTracker due to it&#x27;s useful sorting mechanism and flexible ability to scale a wide assortment of links into a condensed list. The code was retrofit to accept input from a Google spreadsheet allowing for collaborative editing from multiple authors.</p>
              <h3>Inspiration</h3>
              <p>The tracker is inspired by a list that went by the name &#x27;Where&#x27;s the No Man&#x27;s Sky we were sold on?&#x27; which listed a shocking number of absent features players were expecting. The large scope and long development time of Star Citizen make conducting an audit post release difficult to impossible; thus compiling prior to commercial release makes sense. Doing so also puts valuable information into backers hands today, who are currently the major stakeholders of the project.</p>
              <h3>Editors</h3>
              <p>This project would not be possible without a few dedicated Editors. They review crowdsourced feedback and scour the web for expectations set by Cloud Imperium Games concerning &quot;Star Citizen&quot; and it&#x27;s accompanying single player mode &quot;Squadron 42&quot;.
                   
                   Although this tracker is attributed to Goons of the SomethingAwful forums, most Goons are very lazy and volunteer Editors were recruited from other gaming forums. Editors are expected to leave their bias over the controversial development at the door and only organize factual information.</p>
              <h3>Core Tenets</h3>
              <p>Completeness, Clarity, and Accuracy.</p>
              <h3>Anonymity</h3>
              <p>The original author of &#x27;Where&#x27;s the No Man&#x27;s Sky we were sold on?&#x27; was intimidated and tormented by vindictive players. Cloud Imperium Games Corporation has cultivated a certain type of supporter mentality that is often not tolerant towards criticisms which can be perceived when comparing the the lofty expectations of Star Citizen with the current reality. 
                   
                   Perhaps because of the large investments some crowdfunding backers have made, a sizeable portion continue to take anything said about their favorite game very seriously and persecute those who do not embrace the game with the same level of enthusiasm. Anyone contributing to StarCitizen Tracker is encouraged to use an alias when speaking about their work on the tracker or editing the Google spreadsheet. We request that any and all personal details of contributors are not publicized.</p>
              <h3>Motivations</h3>
              <p>Some Editors hope this list encourages the developers to complete each feature and worry less about reworking every asset to perfection. Others are just looking to improve the visualization or completeness of the feature list.</p>
