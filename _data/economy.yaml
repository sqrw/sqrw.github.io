    now have variable pricing that will fluctuate over-time based on stock levels
    and restock rates. Note: Still a work in progress and implemented at major spawn
    locations (GrimHex, Port Olisar, and Levski) only.'

  quote: RSI Site|You will be able to fly a “hot” ship to the less savory parts of
    the Star Citizen universe, where you will probably be able to land and may be
    able to purchase a fake hull id code, but it will take effort and not necessarily
    be cheap.

    of economic disparity between one system and another system. So one of the ways
    would be potentially in one area of the galaxy it would be more expensive to borrow
    money than another area.

    dealing with the goods and the markets, the economy nodes, so on various planets
    there'll be things that produce, things that consume, so there's sort of a very
    high-level meta AI that's running on the economy simulation. And from that high-level
    simulation we can track the sort of movement, the populations, the progress of
    AI, in a sort of much higher-level, abstracted way, and of course since that doesn't
    need to be real time, like you flying around, we can time slice it, which is why
    we can simulate so many agents."
