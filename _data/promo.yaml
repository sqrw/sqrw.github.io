  quote: Erin Roberts|We’re still at the start of the year and there is a lot of scheduling
    work going on so I’m obviously not giving dates today and of course we want to
    give the juicy information to the community first, but we’re looking at putting
    out perhaps 2 or 3 big releases this year which significantly push the amount
    of locations, gameplay mechanics and content that the players will be able to
    experience and give feedback on.

  quote: I know some people are afraid of “feature creep” and the game never being
    finished as we keep adding functionality and content to the mix with increased
    funding. I would say that this would be fair criticism if we were delivering this
    game at retail and on disc.

  quote: Finally there is one very important element – the more funds we can raise
    in the pre-launch phase, the more we can invest in additional content (more ships,
    characters etc.) and perhaps more importantly we can apply greater number of resources
    to the various tasks to ensure we deliver the full functionality sooner rather
    than later.
