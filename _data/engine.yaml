  quote: Erin Roberts|So with the next big release a lot of the underlying game is
    there and then we can look at transferring people between servers so we can have
    hundreds of thousands of people maybe in one instance, but that doesn’t come online
    until later.

  quote: Ben Parry|Sorry to say, do not hold your breath for this. Ignoring the render
    tech for VR itself (which given the work we’ve done, would definitely be a read-and-rewrite
    job, not a merge-this-file job), making a game properly VR compliant takes a lot
    of work at the design and testing level regardless of the engine used. We’d probably
    need to get the framerate up a bit higher too, come to think of it.
