  quote: RSI Site|The ARGO Astronautics MPUV-1C (commonly ‘Argo Cargo’) is a dedicated
    merchant transfer ship, a ubiquitous intergalactic stevedore. Vast numbers of
    Argo Cargos are responsible for loading and unloading goods onto massive long-haul
    transports and miners that cannot otherwise land on planets or drydocks, such
    as the Hull D and the Orion. Some captains choose to own and operate their own
    Argo, while others pay privately owned ships operating as port services a rental
    fee for performing the unloading process.

    mechanic, it'll make whatever you're hauling with it be 'connected' to your ship,
    so you should be able to treat it like dragging around a piece of mass. I don't
    know what the strength of the beam will be yet, but assuming that there's one
    that you can grab hold of, you could fly your ship around and release the asteroid
    with momentum enough to continue in that direction. So potentially I could see
    people using the tractor beam in interesting ways for combat. It'll all be physically
    simulated correctly, think of the tractor beam as a virtual rope, and just like
    that there'll be limits on how big an object and how much mass you can tow etc.

    a message, it gets beamed at the speed of light, and it gets beamed to a relay
    station, or a message station. This is in the structured universe where the UEE
    runs it and there's a lot of infrastructure. So one of these stations is right
    by a jump point so it gets all the information and then it will launch out a message
    drone or a messenger ship. It goes through the jump point to the other side, where
    there's probably another relay station, it's collected, then the data gets beamed
    across to another relay station and so-on and so-forth if it has to go multiple
    systems.

    in to the game mechanics. It's not in organizations yet, but there is some stuff
    that we'll drop in the website that will maybe allow a little bit of that in there,
    and then in the game we will definitely allow people to do a little bit of that.

    of the most dangerous—and lucrative—missions outside the law. The second is secret
    supply depots that you can discover, raid and contest yourself.'

  quote: So the Universe simulation keeps track of all the NPC's. It's the one that's
    dealing with the goods and the markets, the economy nodes, so on various planets
    there'll be things that produce, things that consume, so there's sort of a very
    high-level meta AI that's running on the economy simulation. And from that high-level
    simulation we can track the sort of movement, the populations, the progress of
    AI, in a sort of much higher-level, abstracted way, and of course since that doesn't
    need to be real time, like you flying around, we can time slice it, which is why
    we can simulate so many agents.

  quote: Finally there is one very important element – the more funds we can raise
    in the pre-launch phase, the more we can invest in additional content (more ships,
    characters etc.) and perhaps more importantly we can apply greater number of resources
    to the various tasks to ensure we deliver the full functionality sooner rather
    than later.
