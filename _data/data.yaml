  quote: The way that the communications are gonna work is that it travels our in-fiction
    communication's speed. Which means that when you're in-system and someone beams
    a message, it gets beamed at the speed of light, and it gets beamed to a relay
    station, or a message station. This is in the structured universe where the UEE
    runs it and there's a lot of infrastructure. So one of these stations is right
    by a jump point so it gets all the information and then it will launch out a message
    drone or a messenger ship. It goes through the jump point to the other side, where
    there's probably another relay station, it's collected, then the data gets beamed
    across to another relay station and so-on and so-forth if it has to go multiple
    systems.
