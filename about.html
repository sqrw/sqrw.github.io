                willing to go to in order to get an accurate picture goes above and beyond. If this isn't your first stop

        <p>"Star Citizen is the largest crowdfunding project in history. Its $180 million (and counting) game development budget dwarfs nearly every other on record. Yet a game originally promised to deliver in 2014 remains in pre-alpha in year 6, its history a nearly uninterrupted string of bold claims followed by missed release dates and downsized deliverables with nary an apology.

        With few exceptions, the gaming press has ignored the warning signs and alarm bells of what is likely to become the largest development debacle in both gaming and crowdfunding history.
        
        In the absence of external oversight, of genuine accountability, of truly open development, the burden has fallen on researchers and citizen journalists to raise alarms, counter propaganda, and protect history from its perpetual revision by the demonstrably dishonest and unapologetic, unaccountable leadership of Cloud Imperium Games.
        
        This project tracker is an invaluable resource to that noble end. It is the living history of a catastrophically mismanaged and dishonestly marketed project. 
        
        It is a standing indictment of the gaming press that has largely ignored the growing concerns. 
        
        And it is a rebuke of a studio head who resists accountability and transparency at every turn, despite having pledged to offer it, even as he instead serves up revisionism and propaganda as dismal substitutes for both.
        
        There will one day come a time when that which is largely unspeakable becomes widely obvious; when present heresies become future orthodoxies. The documented history contained herein shows exactly why the present unthinkable is the future inevitable."</p>
