                <p>"StarCitizenTracker presents an unvarnished look at the state of the project, and it's one of the only places I can think of that does so. This in and of itself is praiseworthy, but the lengths the researchers seem willing to go to in order to get an accurate picture goes above and beyond. If this isn't your first stop when checking in on Star Citizen, you're wasting time!"</p>
