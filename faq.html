            <p>Let's be clear, StarCitizen Tracker aims to take an objective look at all data presented. However we also take a skeptical stance to any claims that cannot be substantiated or re-produced.</p>

            <h2>Promise:</h2>
            <p>We use the term loosely, this may be too much of a holdover from the source code of Trump Tracker. Expectation may be more accurate.</p>

            <h4><span class="label label-success">Yes</span> Sets the expectation by telling the customer to imagine it working this way in the final product. Slam dunk in our opinion but doesn't adhere to a strict interpretation of a promise.</h4>

            <p><i>"Our plan is that we're gonna have regular content updates, maybe not weekly, but hopefully at least bi-monthly, as we go, but then we'll also have some much bigger content updates which would be, say another single player campaign like Squadron 42, or the ability to play one of the alien races."</i></p>
            <h4><span class="label label-success">Yes</span> Planned to be in game, even includes a disclaimer. Nevertheless the expectation has been set.</h4>

            <h4><span class="label label-success">Yes with (not on initial release)</span> Saying 'long term' still sets the expectation that it will be included.</h4>

The editor will need to decide if the statement could cause an expectation to be set in a portion of listeners or readers. In these cases the tone of how it was said may also play into the determination.</h4>

                <strong>Note:</strong> this example is included on the main page only because it was <a href="https://youtu.be/7mTLWkxEEeo?t=675">later promised more clearly</a>.

        <h2><strong>In Summary: </strong>Anything said or written that could reasonably or likely cause an expectation to be set.</h2>

        <div class="col-md-12 text-left">
            <h2>Completed:</h2>
            <p>Fairly self explanatory. Was the promise delivered for the most part? Best is if it is still working or accessible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12 text-left">
            <h2>Compromised:</h2>
            <p>Delivered in some form but doesn't quite match the original expectation set in the promise. Also covers items are are Completed but then removed or degraded to the point they don't qualify as Completed anymore. Perfect example is Wingman stuff. Delivered but currently degraded to the point it becomes questionable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12 text-left">
            <h2>In Progress:</h2>
            <p>Best is if customers can currently access it. Features that are starting to work in the alpha version are ‘In progress’. Things that appear on AtV or promo videos do not necessarily qualify as ‘In progress’ and are left to editor discretion. In addition, StarCitizen Tracker takes a skeptical stance towards internal builds because without interacting with the feature for ourself, we do not know for sure if something is pre-rendered or otherwise staged in a non-game tool.</p>
            <p>We are seeing some promises disputed because there is a 3D model for some aspect of a feature. We will not be labeling all NPC promises In progress just because there is an asset for them. In that respect, a feature should be at least 25% complete and testable in the alpha for it to be considered In Progress.</p>
            <p>Sadly our current focus prevents us from keeping In Progress items super accurate. We are primarily focused on adding  promises to the catalog and determining if they are Completed and working or not. With over 300 promises in the list, we do not currently have enough editors to scrutinize the current progress made on each item. Your submissions are invaluable in this regard.</p>

            <h2>Not Started:</h2>
            <p>This is the default. Submit sources if there are grounds to suggest otherwise.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12 text-left">
            <h2>Stagnant:</h2>
            <p>We attach a date to every promise, if more than a few years have passed without testable progress, a promise will be labeled ‘Stagnant’</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12 text-left">
            <h2>Broken:</h2>
            <p>Editor discretion. We may label a promise as ‘Broken’ if we have sufficient consensus or grounds to believe it has been tarnished, ignored, delayed indefinitely, forgotten, or for any other reason lead to believe it will not be delivered. Promises can be labeled as broken with no evidence at all. If you have a source to challenge a promise labeled as ‘Broken’, <a href="">please submit it</a>.</p>
            <p>Because Cloud Imperium Games Corporation calls all of its products a work in progress, we sometimes see it disputed that a promise has not been broken because it is a work in progress, We are happy to re-label items as they become available to alpha testers.</p>
