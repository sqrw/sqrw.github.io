				<h2>Is this Pro or Anti SC?</h2>
				<p>No. The idea is to present facts to let everyone make up their own minds and draw their own conclusions, it doesn't matter to use if you end up liking or hating StarCitizen we just want people to do so in an informed manner.</p>
				<h2>Who maintains this?</h2>
				<p><strong>The community,</strong> we aim to keep every change or submission open and transparent. To do that we adopt open source methodologies, chages are submitted per issues discussed in the open and then included via merge requests.</p>

					<p><i>"We've considered it, we're not 100% sure about doing it, though the system supports it as each thruster is physically modelled correctly and supplies thrust individually. So, I would say that would be something that we'd consider, as it's not too hard, but no promises."</i></p>

			<h2>Completed:</h2>
			<p>Fairly self explanatory. Was the promise delivered for the most part? Best is if it is still working or accessible. To be completed the bar to meet is 'completed in spirit' not 'completed by the letter'.</p>
      <p>For something to be considered completed it will require strong evidence. Being accessible in the current version of the game is one of those, for non game items actual fulfilment (i.e. if a video was promised and is delivred) is another.</p>
      <p>Given that Star Citizen is still in alpha this category will remain fairly empty, the 'in alpha' category is going to be more prominent as it will covere partially finished tasks that are available today</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 text-left">
			<h2>Compromised:</h2>
			<p>Delivered in some form varries significnatly from the original goal. Items can't fairly be considered fully complete but neither broken.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 text-left">
			<h2>In alpha:</h2>
			<p>Best is if customers can currently access it. Features that are starting to work in the alpha version. Things that appear on AtV or promo videos do not necessarily qualify and are left to editor discretion. In addition, StarCitizen Tracker takes a skeptical stance towards internal builds because without interacting with the feature for ourself, we do not know for sure if something is pre-rendered or otherwise staged in a non-game tool.</p>
			<p>We are seeing some promises disputed because there is a 3D model for some aspect of a feature. We will not be labeling all NPC promises In alpha just because there is an asset for them. In that respect, a feature should be at least 25% complete and testable in the alpha for it to be considered.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 text-left">
			<h2>Not implemented:</h2>
			<p>This is the default. Submit sources if there are grounds to suggest otherwise. Features that appear in trailers, promotion material, and the RSI website that are otherwise not yet implemented in the downloadable game.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 text-left">
			<h2>Stagnant:</h2>
			<p>We attach a date to every item, if more than a 3 years have passed without testable progress, the expectation will automatically be labeled ‘Stagnant’</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 text-left">
			<h2>Broken:</h2>
			<p>Items that are clearly not happening despite being promised.</p>
      <p>As with <strong>Completed</strong> this will require hard evidence to support, a official claim "it is not going to happen" would be one of them.</p>
      <p>Again as Star Citizen is still in development this category will be fairly empty as most items that can't be confiremd to be actively worked on will be in <strong>Stagnant</strong>.
